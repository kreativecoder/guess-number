# guess-number

A simple game to demostrate practise my learning in golang so far.

The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

Things I hope to learn from the project:

* Input/Output
* Math Random
* Loops
* Table test cases
* Functions
* Pointers (Still confusing, coming from Java world :))
